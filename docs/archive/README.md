- Describe completed work (refactoring, migrations, deployments)
- Are superseded by newer documentation
- Contain historical context that may be useful for future reference
- Are temporary status reports or completion summaries

## Structure

- `refactoring/` - Refactoring guides, progress reports, and completion summaries
- `deployment/` - Old deployment guides and reports
